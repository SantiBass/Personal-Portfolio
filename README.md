# Personal-Portfolio
 This portfolio contains projects that showcase the abilities and knowledge I have gained so far in my journey
 to become an stack developer. This was the first project that I was assigned to make from scratch. The first
 real design project.
This project has the intention to provide a sense of grow as new concepts are learned. Hyper links, changing the color of 
hyper links while hover over them are few features displayed in this project. VS Code software Version: 1.60.2 was used in the development of this
project along with Google Chrome. Google Chrome Developer Tool is a powerful tool that was used in the process to 
achieve the final product.

This is a learning platform application, which works well based on Web API. When a user opens the application , the user is presented three different categories. These categories are as follows: WORK, PLAY, and, SCHOOL. By clicking and choosing one of these three categories, the user is lead to a subcategory that contains options offered to the user to narrow down the user’s search with more details. By clicking one of these, the user can see different courses based on the API’s search result. This is a simple but effective application that shows what API, JavaScript, CSS and HTML can achieve when they work together.
