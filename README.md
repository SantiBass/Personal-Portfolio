# Personal-Portfolio
 This portfolio contains projects that showcase the abilities and knowledge I have gained so far in my journey
 to become an stack developer. This was the first project that I was assigned to make from scratch. The first
 real design project.
This project has the intention to provide a sense of grow as new concepts are learned. Hyper links, changing the color of 
hyper links while hover over them are few features displayed in this project. VS Code software Version: 1.60.2 was used in the development of this
project along with Google Chrome. Google Chrome Developer Tool is a powerful tool that was used in the process to 
achieve the final product.
